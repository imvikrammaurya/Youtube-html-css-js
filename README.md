# Youtube-html-css-js
This is a YouTube clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I originally created this project back in September last year while revising and learning basic front-end development. However, for some reason, I never uploaded it to GitHubâ€”until today!

If I make any changes to this project in the future, I'll be sure to mention them here.


About This Code
This project is built with HTML, CSS, and a minimal amount of JavaScript. It's a very basic website with a simple structure.
